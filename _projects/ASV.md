*SeaMOOS* is an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) developed as a testbed for autonomous marine vehicle research at the University of New Hampshire. Its design is focused around deploying an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for future use on missions, like autonomous seafloor mapping, requiring collaborative autonomous systems. I worked on this project along with a small team of fellow undergraduates.

    <i>SeaMOOS</i> is an eight foot catamaran style vessel and is powered by dual 55 lb. thrust electric trolling motors. This dual hull design facilitates AUV deployment without compromising the vessel's stability. The ASV runs the MOOS-IvP, a software suite designed for autonomous marine vehicles, which assimilates sensor data and runs the decision making algorithms that determine the vessel's desired course.
