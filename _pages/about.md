I am a M.S. Graduate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois (May 2023). 
My research interest include control systems, robotics, and autonomous systems.

My past [research](/projects/AdditiveManufacturing/) in the [Alleyne Research Group](https://arg.mechse.illinois.edu/) applied strategies from computer vision and control theory to improve the accuracy of direct write additive manufacturing.
